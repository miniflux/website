<h2 id="feature-request">Why are you not developing my feature request? <a class="anchor" href="#feature-request" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

- Developing a software takes a lot of time.
- This is a free and open source project, no one owes you anything.
- If you miss something, contribute to the project.
- Don't expect anyone to work for free.
- As mentioned previously, the number of features is voluntarily limited. Nobody likes bloatware.
- Improving existing features is more important than adding new ones.

<h2 id="missing-feature-v2">Feature X was available in Miniflux v1? <a class="anchor" href="#missing-feature-v2" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

Miniflux 2 doesn't try to reimplement all features of Miniflux 1.
The minimalist approach is pushed a little bit further.

If you really miss something, **you must contribute to the project**, but remember, **you have to keep the minimalist philosophy of Miniflux**.

<h2 id="favicons-storage">Why Miniflux stores favicons into the database? <a class="anchor" href="#favicons-storage" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

Miniflux follows the [the Twelve Factors principle](https://12factor.net/).
Nothing is stored on the local file system.
The application is designed to run on ephemeral containers without persistent storage.

<h2 id="themes">How to create themes for Miniflux 2? <a class="anchor" href="#themes" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

As of now, Miniflux 2 doesn't have any mechanism to load external stylesheets to avoid dependencies.
Themes are embedded into the binary.

If you would like to submit a new official theme, you must send a pull-request.
But do not forget that **you will have to maintain your theme over the time**, otherwise, your theme will be removed from the code base.

<h2 id="plugins">Why there is no plugin system? <a class="anchor" href="#plugins" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

- Because this software has a minimalist approach.
- Because implementing a plugin system increase the complexity of the software.
- Because people do not maintain their plugins after a while.

<h2 id="save-article">What is "Save this article"? <a class="anchor" href="#save-article" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

"Save" sends the feed entry to third-party services like Pinboard or Instapaper if configured.

<h2 id="entries-suppression">How are items removed from the database? <a class="anchor" href="#entries-suppression" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

When a subscription is refreshed, entries marked as "removed" and not visible anymore in the XML feed are removed from the database.

<h2 id="flush-history">What "Flush History" does? <a class="anchor" href="#flush-history" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

"Flush History" changes the status of entries from "read" to "removed" (except for bookmarks).
Entries with the status "removed" are not visible in the user interface.

<h2 id="arm-pi">Which binary do I need to use on my Raspberry Pi? <a class="anchor" href="#arm-pi" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

Raspberry Pi Model  | Miniflux Binary
--------------------|---------------------
A, A+, B, B+, Zero  | miniflux-linux-armv6
2 and 3             | miniflux-linux-armv7

<h2 id="arm-scaleway">Which binary do I need to use on Scaleway ARM machines? <a class="anchor" href="#arm-scaleway" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

Server Type    | Miniflux Binary       | uname -m
---------------|-----------------------|---------
Scaleway C1    | miniflux-linux-armv6  |  armv7l
Scaleway ARM64 | miniflux-linux-armv8  |  aarch6

<h2 id="docker-arch">Which Docker architecture should I use? <a class="anchor" href="#docker-arch" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

Pulling the `latest` tag or a specific version should download the correct image according to your machine.

Docker Architecture | uname -m | Example
--------------------|----------|---------------
amd64               |  x86_64  |
arm32v6             |  armhf   | Raspberry Pi
arm32v6             |  armv7l  | Scaleway C1
arm64v8             |  aarch6  | Scaleway ARM64

If you use the wrong architecture, Docker will returns an error like this one:

```
standard_init_linux.go:178: exec user process caused "exec format error"
```

<p class="info">Multi-arch Docker images are available only since Miniflux 2.0.12.</p>

<h2 id="sql-migrations">Why SQL migrations are not executed automatically? <a class="anchor" href="#sql-migrations" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

- Because it's a source of problems.
- Only one process should manipulate the database schema at once.
- If you run multiple containers with an orchestrator that may cause issues.
- You can still run the migrations by defining the variable `RUN_MIGRATIONS=1`.

<h2 id="backup">How to backup my data? <a class="anchor" href="#backup" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

You can use standard Postgresql tools: [pgdump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html)
