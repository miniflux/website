Miniflux's Website
==================

Miniflux's website is a simple static HTML website hosted on GitHub Pages.

There is no Javascript or tracking at all.

- Each page is a Markdown file stored into the `src` folder.
- Templates are stored into the folder `templates`.
- The generated HTML documents are stored in the root folder.

[plop](https://github.com/fguillot/plop) is the tool used to generate the HTML files.

Note: **Do not edit generated HTML files directly**, edit the Markdown version in `src` folder.
