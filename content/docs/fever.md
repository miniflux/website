Miniflux implements the [Fever API](https://feedafever.com/api) in addition to its own [REST API](api.html). The
Fever API allows you to use existing mobile applications to read your
feeds instead of the web user interface.

To activate the Fever API, go to the integration section and choose a username/password.
